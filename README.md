# The Nelson Auction Project
## Goal
  The purpose of this project is to creat an embedable web application onto Nelson Public High School's web site to run a charity holiday auction.
  
## Overview
  This web app will be written in React-Bootstrap and Google Sheets API to export the auction bidding data onto a Google Sheets spreadsheet to determine the winner of each of the charity gift baskets.
  
## Current Build
  A live viewable version of the web app can be found [here](https://www.mattgrinton.com)
