# The Nelson Auction Project
### Project Author: Matthew Grinton
## Goal
  The purpose of this project is to creat an embedable web application onto Nelson Public High School's web site to run a charity holiday auction.
  
## Overview
  This web app will be written in React-Bootstrap and Google Sheets API to export the auction bidding data onto a Google Sheets spreadsheet to determine the winner of each of the charity gift baskets.
  
## Current Build

## Nelson Project 2.0
  The second version of the nelson project will be designed primarily as a mobile app with secondary web functionality
